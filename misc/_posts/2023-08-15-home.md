In the Design Innovation & Generative InTelligence (DIGIT) Lab, we study and create AI and machine learning methods for engineering design, with the goal of solving the most challenging design problems including high-dimensional problems, inverse design problems, design under uncertainty, and novel design discovery. We work together to build a future where AI augments humans in design tasks in terms of **efficiency**, **creativity**, **complex reasoning**, and **trustworthiness**.

Through our research, we aim to develop general design tools that can be broadly applied to solving complex design problems in many science and engineering domains, such as aerodynamic design, functional materials design, soft robot design, and design for manufacturing.

For more information, you can explore our [**paper collection**](/papers/) or check out our [**open-source code**](https://www.github.com/DIGITLab23).

We have openings for **fully-funded Ph.D. positions** starting Fall 2024. If you are interested in pursuing a Ph.D. and are passionate about AI and machine learning for engineering design, please don't hesitate to email Dr. Wei Chen at [w.chen@tamu.edu](mailto:w.chen@tamu.edu). Please include your CV, transcript, and a short description of your research interest (â‰¤ 200 words) and put "DIGIT Research Assistant Position" in the subject line.
